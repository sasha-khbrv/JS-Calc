CodePan: https://codepen.io/a_khabarova/pen/ZEpEWdK

Made from the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw

Added some new features: 
 + you can change operations without calculation
 + an expression like "2+=" is equal to " 2+2"
 + the entire expression is displayed after clicking the equals button
 + you can continue calculating with the previous result
 + some validations for empties values
 
In future:
 - add validations for calculating with float numbers
 - add more functions to equal button
 - add tests
